## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I learned how to use `object-fit` and `object-position`, although I would love to know how others went about this, as I don't like my final result. I also learned it can be difficult to style an SVG that is being used in an `<img>`. I ended up using `filter: brightness(100);` to change the socials icon button color when active. If there is a better way, I'd love to hear it!

### Continued development

I will continue to explore how to use images in a responsive way, along with fluid responsive design concepts.
